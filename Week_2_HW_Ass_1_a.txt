Test Case No: NFT-001 - Load Testing**\n\n**Description:** Verify that the bus search interface responds properly under load and does not time out or become unresponsive.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to ensure that the bus search interface can handle a large number of concurrent users and respond promptly to searches without any delay or errors.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n- Use a multi-user testing tool such as Apache JMeter to simulate a large number of concurrent users searching for buses.\n- Monitor the response time and ensure it does not exceed 2 seconds.\n- Repeat the test with increasing numbers of users to verify the scalability of the system.\n- Verify that the bus search results are accurate and relevant during the load test.\n\n**Type of Test case:** Load Testing\n\n**2. Test Case No: NFT-002 - Performance Testing**\n\n**Description:** Verify that the bus search interface responds quickly and accurately under various network conditions.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to ensure that the bus search interface provides a responsive user experience even with varying network speeds and conditions.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n- Conduct a performance test using a tool such as Gatling or Locust to simulate different network conditions (e.g., 3G, 4G, Wi-Fi).\n- Verify that the bus search results are accurate and relevant under each network condition.\n- Monitor the response time and ensure it does not exceed 1 second.\n- Repeat the test with varying numbers of concurrent users to verify the scalability of the system.\n\n**Type of Test case:** Performance Testing\n\n**3. Test Case No: NFT-003 - Stress Testing**\n\n**Description:** Verify that the bus search interface can handle a maximum load without failing or crashing.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to ensure that the bus search interface can handle a high volume of traffic without any errors or failures.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n- Conduct a stress test using a tool such as Apache JMeter or Locust to simulate an extremely high load on the system.\n- Monitor the system's resources (e.g., CPU, memory) and ensure they do not exceed 90% utilization.\n- Verify that the bus search results are accurate and relevant during the stress test.\n- Check for any errors or exceptions in the system logs during the stress test.\n\n**Type of Test case:** Stress Testing\n\n**4. Test Case No: NFT-004 - Security Testing (XSS)**\n\n**Description:** Verify that the bus search interface prevents cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to ensure that the bus search interface protects against XSS attacks that could compromise user security.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n- Conduct an XSS test using a tool such as Burp Suite or ZAP to inject malicious scripts into the system.\n- Verify that the system detects and prevents the injected malicious scripts from executing.\n- Monitor the system logs for any suspicious activity or errors during the XSS test.\n- Repeat the test with varying types of malicious scripts to ensure the system is robust against XSS attacks.\n\n**Type of Test case:** Security Testing\n\n**5. Test Case No: NFT-005 - Accessibility Testing**\n\n**Description:** Verify that the bus search interface is accessible and usable by users with disabilities.\n\n**Objective:** The objective is to ensure that the bus search interface meets accessibility standards and provides an inclusive user experience.\n\n**Test Steps:**\n\n- Conduct an accessibility test using a tool such as WAVE or Lighthouse to evaluate the system's accessibility.\n- Verify that the system meets all relevant accessibility standards and guidelines (e.g., WCAG 2.1).\n- Test the system with assistive technologies (e.g., screen readers) to ensure it is usable by users with disabilities.\n- Repeat the test with varying types of assistive technologies to ensure the system is robust and accessible.\n\n**Type of Test case:** Accessibility Testing"
